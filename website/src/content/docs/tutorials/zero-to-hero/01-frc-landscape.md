  <p>Before we touch a single line of Java or look at a physical robot, you must understand the toolchain we use to build, track, and deploy code. FRC development is uniquely complex because it relies heavily on offline-capable environments and cross-platform utilities.</p>

  <h2>1. Version Control (Git & GitHub)</h2>
  <div class="callout callout-info">
    <h4>What is Git?</h4>
    <p><a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> is a "Time Machine" for your code. It tracks exactly who changed which lines in a file, allowing multiple robot programmers to safely write code simultaneously without accidentally deleting each other's work.</p>
  </div>

  <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a></strong> is the website where our Git time machine is stored. The typical workflow:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Pull the latest code from GitHub to your laptop via a <code>git pull</code>.</li>
    <li>Write your new mechanism logic.</li>
    <li>Commit (save) your changes using <code>git commit</code>.</li>
    <li>Push the changes back to the cloud using <code>git push</code>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>2. Build Systems & Gradle</h2>
  <p>Unlike standard Java projects where you right-click a file and click "Run," FRC robots require compiling the Java into an executable and mathematically shipping it securely over a Radio connection to the RoboRIO.</p>

  <p>We use <strong><a href="https://gradle.org/" target="_blank">Gradle</a></strong> as our build manager. You will exclusively interact with the <code>build.gradle</code> file to manage versions. When you run a command like <code>./gradlew build</code>, Gradle locally grabs the code, links the libraries, checks for errors, and compresses it.</p>

  <h3>Vendordeps (Vendor Dependencies)</h3>
  <p>Because FRC robots operate offline (you don't have internet on the competition field!), standard cloud-based dependency management fails. Instead, WPILib uses `.json` files wrapped as <strong>Vendordeps</strong>. These json files command Gradle to download third-party libraries (like Phoenix 6 or PathPlanner) to your local laptop *before* the match so that you can compile offline seamlessly.</p>

  <h2>3. The FRC Tool Suite</h2>
  <p>You cannot code an FRC robot with Notepad. You'll need the following mandatory software:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases" target="_blank">WPILib VS Code</a></strong>: The official Microsoft IDE heavily modified to support deploying code directly to the RoboRIO via Gradle.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/driverstation/index.html" target="_blank">The Driver Station</a></strong>: The official application that connects your Xbox Controllers on the laptop to the robot over the WiFi Radio. This is required to Enable/Disable the robot.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://pro.ctr-electronics.com/docs/tuner/index.html" target="_blank">Phoenix Tuner X</a></strong>: A standalone app by CTRE. Used exclusively for flashing firmware and assigning CAN IDs to hardware.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://advantagescope.org/" target="_blank">AdvantageScope</a></strong>: An open-source 3D visualizer that parses MARSLib telemetry logs natively into beautiful graphs, field layouts, and robot renders.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://pathplanner.dev/" target="_blank">PathPlanner</a></strong>: An external GUI for drawing autonomous splines on a 2D map of the field layout. It outputs `JSON` coordinates to our deployment pipeline.</li>
  </ul>
